## About me

Well versed DevOps and cloud engineer, with a strong passion and enthusiasm for cloud, architecture, development, build/deploy automation and reliability.

My career began as a PHP developer, doing front and back end development for a growing startup, using open source technology. I then transitioned into iOS app development, followed by environment management and now to the DevOps and cloud space, which is where I specialise in. I've always enjoyed introducing appropriate tooling to make the lives of developers, testers and configuration management teams easier. It gives me great satisfaction everytime a solution comes into fruition and is ultimately well received by team members.

I seek unique and exciting opportunities in areas I'm passionate about, where I am able to continue growing and developing my leadership and technical skills.

## Skills

#### Technical ability

I possess a strong technical background, and this has enabled me to pick up several languages/technologies very quickly. Since the beginning of my career, I've picked up the on the following:

- Languages: Java, PHP, Python, Bash, Perl, Groovy DSL
- Source code management: Git, SVN
- DevOps: Jenkins, Teamcity, Docker, Puppet, Ansible
- Operating Systems: RHEL and AIX
- Build sytems: Gradle, Maven, Nexus
- Scheduling tools: Autosys, Tivoli
- Oracle: CCB, Webcenter Sites, Oracle DB
- IBM: Sterling Order management, Websphere Message Broker, Websphere Commerce Server, IBM Datastage, DB2
- Trading platforms: Murex
- Cloud platforms: AWS and GCP

#### DevOps delivery

- Setting up the CI processes from the ground up, with the build and deployment centred around Oracle CCB, Oracle DB, Oracle WCS and IBM Datastage for a greenfield Oracle based customer transformation program.

- Owned technical architecture work, involving small to medium change requests, delivering to completion. I was also involved in resolving painful recurring issues in our test environments, and moving to a more consistent method to environment management.

- Introduced a brand new CI approach for an agile based scrum team, which enabled visualisation of a CI pipeline and made use of an open source chat platform, which integrates with other components of the CI process, including Jenkins, SonarQube and Nexus.

- Implemented CI and automation around the Murex trading platform. Much of my focus has been around the creation of a jobs-as-code approach for Autosys batch schedules, and improving the existing processes of the core application, covering different areas of Murex..

- Managed small, agile onshore and offshore teams to deliver key CI deliverables.

#### Communicating/presenting

Held several brown bag sessions and workshops, which involved introducing people to Continuous Integration and demonstrating the benefits that the CI process would have to the Software Development Life Cycle. Much of the work presented was well received and was since taken forward by client DevOps teams.
